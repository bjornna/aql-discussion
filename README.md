# What is this?

see: see https://github.com/bjornna/openehr-conformance/blob/master/aql/case1-permutations/index.adoc for the questions that led to the creation of this repository first.

This reqpository contains two directories in response to the questions and comments in the link above. 

* sparql: an ontology written in turtle syntax along with sparql queries that correspond to aql concepts under discussion
* xquery: an xml file and xquery files that corresponds to xquery version of the same concepts

### How do I run these?
#### sparql:
Download protege 5.2.0 from http://protege.stanford.edu/ . Enable a reasoner and use snap sparql query view. You need a reasoner running and obviously you need to install the plugins that enable the features mentioned here. Protege gives you the option when you start it up. Load the turtle file and run the queries. 

#### xquery:
Go to http://www.xpathtester.com/xquery , provide the xml file contents and run the xquery queries
